# Deprecated Long Tests

The `longtest_*.jl` files were exploratory Monte Carlo scripts that predate the current test
infrastructure. They are no longer run as part of `Pkg.test()` and are kept only for manual
reference. Run them directly from this folder if you need to reproduce the old experiments, but
expect long runtimes and unmaintained APIs.
