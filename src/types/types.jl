# =============================================================================
# Types Module - Placeholder for Future Type Consolidation
# =============================================================================
#
# This module will eventually contain all type definitions for MultistateModels.jl.
# Currently, types remain in their original locations (common.jl, etc.) for
# backward compatibility.
#
# The individual files (hazards.jl, models.jl, etc.) contain extracted type
# definitions that can be incrementally migrated.
#
# Migration Status:
# - [x] Directory structure created
# - [x] Type definitions extracted to individual files
# - [ ] Integration with main module
# - [ ] Tests passing
#
# See: scratch/optimization_plan/07_file_reorganization.md for full plan
# =============================================================================

# NOTE: Do not include these files yet - they are drafts for future migration
# include("utilities.jl")
# include("configuration.jl")
# include("hazards.jl")
# include("surrogates.jl")
# include("models.jl")
# include("data.jl")
