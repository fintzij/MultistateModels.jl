# scratch/

This folder is for development notes, one-off scripts, and handoff docs.

## Current handoffs / notes

- [PIJCV implicit differentiation handoff (A+B)](PIJCV_IMPLICIT_DIFF_HANDOFF_2026-01-27.md)
- [PIJCV/NCV strategies + mgcv/Wood alignment notes](PIJCV_NCV_STRATEGIES_2026-01-28.md)

## Hygiene

- Quarto/HTML build artifacts in `scratch/*.html` and `scratch/*_files/` are intentionally ignored (see `.gitignore`).
- Older notes can live in `scratch/archive/` (also ignored).
