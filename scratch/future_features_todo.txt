================================================================================
FEATURE: SPLINE FUNCTIONS ON COVARIATES
================================================================================

Status: Not started
Priority: HIGH

MOTIVATION:
- Allow flexible, non-linear covariate effects
- Common in survival analysis (e.g., age effects often non-linear)
- Natural extension of current spline hazard infrastructure

DESIGN IDEAS:
```julia
# Option 1: Formula-based syntax (like R's mgcv)
h12 = Hazard(@formula(0 ~ 1 + s(age) + treatment), :wei, 1, 2)

# Option 2: Explicit spline covariate term
h12 = Hazard(@formula(0 ~ 1 + treatment), :wei, 1, 2;
             spline_covars = [SplineCovariate(:age, degree=3, nknots=5)])
```

KEY QUESTIONS:
- How to integrate with StatsModels.jl formula interface?
- Should share infrastructure with RuntimeSplineHazard?
- Need automatic knot placement based on covariate distribution
- Penalization for smooth covariate effects?

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Reuse BSplines.jl infrastructure from hazard splines
- Knots placed at quantiles of covariate distribution
- May need to extend extract_covar_names() and covariate handling

================================================================================
FEATURE: PENALIZED SPLINES (NEXT PRIORITY)
================================================================================

Status: Planning complete, implementation deferred
Priority: HIGH (after basic splines work)

MOTIVATION:
- MSMs are uniquely sensitive to knot placement
- Need automatic smoothing to reduce sensitivity
- Want to avoid manual knot selection entirely if possible

PENALTY OPTIONS:
1. P-SPLINE: λ * θ' D' D θ (D = differencing matrix)
2. SHARED SMOOTHING: All transitions share same λ
3. JOINT TOTAL HAZARD: Penalize wigglyness of total cumulative hazard

SMOOTHING PARAMETER SELECTION:
- LAML (default): Laplace approximate marginal likelihood
- GCV/LCV: Leave-one-out cross-validation
- NCV: Neighborhood cross-validation (Wood 2020)

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:

================================================================================
FEATURE: CUSTOM HAZARD FUNCTIONS
================================================================================

Status: Not started
Priority: HIGH (prerequisite for neural hazards)

DESIGN: Two paths available

Path 1: CustomHazard (user provides functions)
```julia
h = CustomHazard(
    hazard_fn = (t, θ, x) -> θ[1] * θ[2] * t^(θ[2]-1),
    cumhaz_fn = (t, θ, x) -> θ[1] * t^θ[2],
    n_params = 2,
    statefrom = 1, stateto = 2
)
```

Path 2: SymbolicHazard (automatic cumhaz derivation via Symbolics.jl)
```julia
@variables t θ[1:2]
h = SymbolicHazard(
    hazard = θ[1] * θ[2] * t^(θ[2]-1),
    statefrom = 1, stateto = 2
)
```

================================================================================
CONSIDERATION: OPTIMIZATION/IDENTIFIABILITY WARNINGS
================================================================================

Status: Not started
Priority: LOW
Added: 2025-12-15

MOTIVATION:
- Phase-type models with many phases/destinations may have identifiability issues
- Users may not realize when parameters are poorly identified

POTENTIAL WARNINGS TO ADD:
1. Singular or near-singular covariance matrix after optimization
2. Optimization fails to converge (already may exist, but verify)
3. Hessian has negative eigenvalues (non-PSD)
4. Very large standard errors relative to estimates

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:
- Should be opt-in or opt-out?
- Info vs warning level?
- How to detect "near-singular" (condition number threshold?)

NOTES:
- Don't want to overwhelm users with false positives
- May be better as a post-fit diagnostic function rather than automatic warning
================================================================================
FEATURE: NUMERICAL STABILITY IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================
Added: 2025-12-15

MOTIVATION:
- Phase-type and complex multistate models can suffer from numerical overflow/underflow
- Matrix exponentials of large intensity matrices can lose precision
- Forward algorithm probabilities can underflow for long observation intervals
- Cumulative hazards can overflow for high-rate transitions

AREAS TO EXPLORE:
1. Log-scale forward algorithm (log-sum-exp trick) for likelihood computation
2. Uniformization for matrix exponentials instead of direct expm()
3. Scaling and squaring improvements for matrix exponentials
4. Log-probability tracking through TPM computations
5. Numerical safeguards in phase-type density calculations

SPECIFIC CONCERNS:
- exp(Q*dt) can overflow/underflow for large rates or long intervals
- Forward algorithm multiplies many small probabilities
- Phase-type density π'exp(Sτ)r involves potentially very small exp(Sτ) entries
