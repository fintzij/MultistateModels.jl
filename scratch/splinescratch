# or do it all in R and copy back only when needed. seems faster

# notes
# probably best to hand off splines to splines2 in R
# shouldn't be a problem for autodiff 
# see rstanarm for parameterization
# modifications needed for optional arguments to hazard functions
# need additional spline related basis objects, maybe bookkeeping
# should be able to extend @formula to use splines2+RCall as shown in MC's splines2 repo
